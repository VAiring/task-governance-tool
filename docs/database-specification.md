# Database Persistence And Migration Specification

This document owns database initialization, supported persistence, admission,
and migration behavior delegated by the
[product specification](specification.md#sqlite-migration-and-concurrency).
Supported predecessor schemas remain current compatibility contracts, not
historical authority.

The [implementation design](database-design.md) owns physical structures and
migration mechanics. The shared
[Runner protocol](specification.md#schema-v21-persistence-compatibility-and-shared-runner-protocol)
and [operational read/write boundary](specification.md#operational-readwrite-boundary)
remain in the root specification. Explicit setup and recovery operations
remain with the [Setup/state owner](setup-state-specification.md#setup-recovery-evidence-backup-and-viewer-maintenance).

## Migration And Activation Boundary

Schema v17 migration `verification_receipts` creates
one append-only Receipt table and adds the three internal completion-cycle
basis fields through the storage/repository layer. Receipt ownership, target,
uniqueness, link, and qualifying relationships are validated in SQLite and
again on read. Existing cycle rows receive only the version-0/null-digest/
null-link legacy discriminator; the migration synthesizes no Receipt from Task
verification prose, events, `verification_attestation`, completion cycles, M20
observations, command history, or review receipts. Existing done Tasks and
cycles therefore remain honest legacy attestation history. The insert guard
also preserves the pre-existing sole compatibility bridge's exact
`legacy_current_done` partial version-0/null/null shape while rejecting every
other new version-0 cycle.

Migration 18 `evidence_ledger_capture` adds immutable authority snapshots,
whole-field criteria and links, normalized Review provenance, artifact
manifests and entries, Evidence References, current snapshot pointers,
capture-version target bindings, and Verification subject columns. It creates
one exact current-basis legacy snapshot per Task but no historical target
binding, manifest, Reference, provenance row, subject, Receipt, Finding, or
cycle. Reentry validates exact ownership, digests, matrices, triggers, quick
check, and foreign keys without reconciliation or backfill.

## Initialization And Supported Schemas

`setup` is the sole public initializer and migrator. No Task, handoff, review,
doctor, read, or write command creates/migrates a missing/old database.
Missing state is `db_not_initialized`; supported older state is
`migration_required`; a newer schema is `schema_too_new`. Old binaries reject
newer state and never downgrade/write it.

Fresh setup creates schema v22. Structurally complete contiguous source schemas
v1-v21 are setup-only migration inputs; v22 is idempotent current state.
Schema sequence is:

| Version | Durable addition |
|---:|---|
| v1-v4 | original Task/event/project and completion-evidence lineage |
| v5 | structured review target, receipt, and finding state |
| v6 | Git-snapshot base revision |
| v7 | local handoff outbox |
| v8 | immutable Task Contract revisions |
| v9 | optional Effort basis/activity metadata |
| v10 | maintenance opt-in, policy, latest backup/outcome/applied retention |
| v11 | managed backup generation ledger |
| v12 | append-only checkpoints |
| v13 | Viewer source/render generation and outcomes |
| v14 | stable identity, binding/history, and cleanup metadata |
| v15 | completion-cycle history |
| v16 | marker-only native capture activation |
| v17 | immutable Verification Receipts and completion-cycle verification basis |
| v18 | authority/criterion capture, Review provenance, target manifests, Evidence References, and Verification subjects |
| v19 | native completion Bundles, criterion links/Finding snapshots, and Evidence JSON projection state |
| v20 | verification Runner shadow storage and Bundle-v2 null-Runner tagged union |
| v21 | verification Runner gate-basis tags using the existing schema-v20 structures |
| v22 | retired Analyzer reservation cleanup in the existing Evidence/Bundle tables |

Each migration is transactional, idempotent, rollback-tested, validates
contiguous history and required objects/rows, preserves project/business IDs
and durable records, and passes `quick_check` and foreign keys. Acceptance
retains the realistic 12-Task/191-event fixture and historical completion/
review trace through every supported source version. No migration parses
private prose to invent structure.

## Schema-v20 Foundation And Admission

The migration implementation retains one non-public helper restricted to an
explicitly injected database path. It migrates one caller-owned disposable v19
database in
place, at the same path, inside one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction. It performs
no copy, backup, publication, managed recovery, or canonical-state operation.
Rollback restores the logical schema and data; SQLite file-byte identity is not
claimed.

Migration 20 is exactly `verification_runner_shadow`. It preserves every
existing v19 business row and stable ID, including the canonical payload bytes
and digest of each existing version-1 Bundle. Existing Task Runner markers are
zero and existing cycle/Bundle Runner basis fields are null; the four new
immutable Runner tables and new Runner Evidence rows start empty. Schema-v20
Bundle version 2 admits only `caller_attestation` or `not_required`, and its
Runner observation pointer is always null. Any Runner observation, Reference,
or criterion link remains standalone audit history and is never a completion
cycle or Bundle basis at schema v20. Every schema-v20 Runner record is
gate-ineligible version `0`. The migration owns only the complete physical DDL
and storage-parent integrity; plan, process, observation, cleanup, and service
admission are separate current Runner subsystem boundaries.
The Bundle table rebuild does not preserve or replay arbitrary caller DDL. A
persistent index or trigger whose name is not migration-owned but whose
`sqlite_master.tbl_name` is `completion_evidence_bundles` is unsupported
attached residue: successful migration removes it with the old v19 Bundle
table, while transaction rollback restores it. Unrelated standalone objects
not attached to the rebuilt table remain unchanged.
Marker-only, partial-owned-object, same-version owned-object drift, a known
later marker, busy/contention, integrity, or foreign-key failure is fail-closed
and leaves no partial migration.

The supported schema-v20 compatibility foundation retains the
Bundle-v2 null-Runner payload/serialization/digest writer, and schema-v20
compatibility for Evidence JSON, Viewer, and managed backup/recovery. The
schema activation itself creates no Runner resolution, attempt, sandbox event,
observation, Evidence Reference/link, Bundle member, or Runner projection.
Canonical database migration occurs only through explicit public setup.

Public admission distinguishes a complete v19 source from a hybrid before any
mutation. A database declared as v19 but containing any recognized v20-owned
table, explicit index, trigger, or column fails closed in the canonical
resolver, setup inspection/migration, Viewer, and managed backup/recovery paths.
Recognition follows SQLite's case-insensitive identifier equality: any catalog
object occupying a v20-owned table, explicit-index, or trigger name is a
collision, while a column marker is scoped to its designated parent table.
Generated columns are column markers under the same rule.
Complete-v20 migration admission accepts either empty Runner tables and
Reference/link sets or the exact [audit-only Runner graph](runner-execution-specification.md#parent-service-and-audit-graph).
It rejects a malformed, duplicate, foreign-owned, partially linked, or
gate-eligible Runner graph. Every Task Runner-basis marker remains zero and
every cycle/Bundle Runner-observation pointer remains null; native Bundle-v2
`caller_attestation` and `not_required` verification basis remains valid.
This check occurs before any database or sidecar write, migration backup,
recovery copy/publication, Viewer publication, or managed-backup write. A complete v19 source alone may invoke migration
20; a complete v20 source continues through migrations 21 and 22, and a complete
v21 source invokes migration 22. Exact v22 receives validation-only reentry. Unrelated extra
objects retain the existing policy, including deliberate removal of
unsupported unowned indexes/triggers attached to the rebuilt Bundle table and
preservation of unrelated standalone objects.

Schema v20 is an audit-only Runner foundation and never becomes a qualifying
Runner gate basis. The current schema-v22 delta below retains the schema-v21
qualifying Runner protocol with explicit manual fallback.

## Current Schema-v22 Persistence Contract

Schema v22 is the public schema constant and setup target. Setup reaches it
through the existing ordered migrations from complete v1-v21 sources; v20
continues through 21 and then 22 rather than returning early. Exact-v22
reentry is validation-only. Ordinary commands never migrate or repair state.

Migration 22 is exactly `evidence_reservation_cleanup`. It rebuilds only
`evidence_references`, `criterion_evidence_links`, and
`completion_evidence_bundles`, restores their owned indexes/triggers and the
coupled Evidence cycle guard, and retains all business columns and the
35-table/42-index/59-trigger inventory. Current allow-lists remove
`derived_analysis` source/relation, `llm_derived` assurance, and `batch_analyzer`
producer; `deterministically_derived` and all other valid Evidence remain.
Complete source validation rejects unexpected retired-value rows and unowned
indexes/triggers attached to any of those three rebuilt tables before rebuild;
it never deletes, converts, or invents a replacement for such rows or objects.
Unrelated objects retain the established preservation policy.

Valid business rows, IDs, relations, provenance, completion history, and sealed
source-19/v1 and source-20/21/v2 Bundle payloads/source versions/bytes/digests
are preserved. The Bundle tagged union adds source 22/format 2 with the same
three basis arms as source 21 in the
[shared Runner protocol](specification.md#schema-v21-persistence-compatibility-and-shared-runner-protocol).
New native completion obtains source 22
from its locked database basis for both the stored Bundle and its payload;
the native cycle guard requires that source. No caller chooses it. The format-2
index reports the actual container schema 22 and may change bytes/digest while
referencing unchanged old Bundles. A source-22 Bundle is not admitted in a
physical schema-21 container. No format, digest domain, or evidence assurance
is upgraded by migration or projection.

Migration follows the existing foreign-key-off/legacy-alter-on transaction,
exact row/object preservation, integrity checks, marker-last, and connection-
setting restoration pattern. It rechecks preserved rows after the marker and
full v22 validation before commit, including effects of admitted unrelated
triggers. Failure restores logical schema/data, not byte-identical SQLite
files. Exact-v22 reentry rejects unexpected attachments and migration temporary
residue without repair. Setup retains its pre-migration managed backup and
matched package/database/artifact rollback boundary; older code rejects v22.

Current Task/Receipt/completion and Runner selection retain the schema-v21
[protocol](specification.md#schema-v21-persistence-compatibility-and-shared-runner-protocol),
including audit-only old graphs, no-relaunch recovery, live
implementation-drift invalidation, and self-contained done history. Setup,
doctor, backup/recovery, resolver/relocation, and Viewer admit v22 through their
existing boundaries. Recovery extends the same verification-only candidate-
local rejection rule through source 22; every other structural Task/Runner/
Bundle fault remains set-fatal. Viewer remains snapshot v4, accepts v5-v22,
validates and discards Evidence/Runner internals, and changes no public field
or UI. No CLI shape, Skill trigger/procedure/call, config, Runner runtime, gate,
or general migration framework is added.
