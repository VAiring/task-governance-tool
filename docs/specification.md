# task-governance-tool MVP Specification

Status: formal MVP baseline plus approved TG-M8 governance-hardening
requirements. TG-M8 behavior is not implemented until its roadmap units pass
their verification and review gates.

This document defines the first product contract for `task-governance-tool`.
It supersedes `plan.md` for MVP product behavior. `docs/implementation-roadmap.md`
governs implementation order and execution-unit boundaries. `plan.md` remains
the decision log and open-issue holding area.

## Product Goal

`task-governance-tool` helps Codex and the user run project work without loading
large task-status Markdown files into context. The MVP replaces the practical
functions of a large `TASK_STATUS.md`: register tasks, inspect current work,
select next actionable work, record blockers, and keep concise local task
history.

The tool must stay local-first, project-doc-respecting, and non-authoritative.
Target project governing documents remain the source of truth for project
decisions.

## MVP Scope

The MVP includes:

- A Codex skill named `task-governance-tool`.
- A Python stdlib-first CLI named `taskgov`.
- A SQLite state store scoped to one governed project per installed skill copy
  by default.
- Task registration and inspection commands:
  - `taskgov db init`
  - `taskgov db status`
  - `taskgov task add`
  - `taskgov task list`
  - `taskgov task next`
  - `taskgov task show`
  - `taskgov task edit`
- JSON output for Codex and concise text output for humans.
- Project-scoped skill-local generated runtime state under the installed skill
  folder.
- Offline operation by default.

## Non-Goals For MVP

The MVP does not include:

- Importing tasks from Markdown or planning documents.
- Draft/approval workflows such as `task approve`.
- A standalone dependency graph or `task depend`.
- Persistent project profile authoring or `profile register`.
- Verification-run recording beyond short task fields.
- Review request generation.
- Creating Git commits, branches, PRs, issue comments, or other target-project
  mutation. TG-M8 may inspect Git read-only to validate an existing commit, but
  `taskgov` must not create or change Git state.
- Live dashboards, services, network sync, or cloud workflows. The approved
  post-MVP static Task Viewer extension below is not a live dashboard or
  service.
- Raw command-output retention.

## Skill Package Requirements

The installable skill folder name and `SKILL.md` frontmatter `name` must be
`task-governance-tool`.

The MVP is intended for project-scoped installation. Install a separate copy of
the skill into each governed project that needs task tracking:

```text
<target-project>/.agents/skills/task-governance-tool/
```

User-wide installation is not recommended for normal MVP use because it can
blur task state across projects. Use a user-wide install only for explicit local
experimentation, and prefer an explicit `--db` path if doing so.

Project-scoped setup is a distinct, explicit step after installation. The
installer or agent must verify that generated `state/` is ignored, inspect with
`taskgov db status`, and then run `taskgov db init --repo <target-project>` with
user approval. Building the source skill package must not create a database,
because the target project identity is not known at package-build time.

The skill package should contain only files needed by Codex to use the skill:

```text
task-governance-tool/
  SKILL.md
  agents/
    openai.yaml
  scripts/
    taskgov.py
    task_governance_tool/
  references/
    task_workflow.md
    cli_contracts.md
```

The skill package may create generated local runtime state after installation:

```text
task-governance-tool/
  state/
    projects/
      <project-id>/
        taskgov.sqlite
```

`state/` is not part of the static skill package and must not be committed or
exported.

Runtime code required by `scripts/taskgov.py` must be included inside the skill
package so the installed skill is self-contained.

After the approved static Task Viewer extension is implemented, the package
must additionally include:

```text
task-governance-tool/
  assets/
    task-viewer.template.html
  scripts/
    task_governance_tool/
      viewer.py
```

The bundled template is static runtime input. Generated `task-viewer.html`
snapshots remain under `state/` and are not part of the package.

## Data Location

Default database path:

```text
<installed-skill-root>/state/projects/<project-id>/taskgov.sqlite
```

With the recommended project-scoped install, this resolves under:

```text
<target-project>/.agents/skills/task-governance-tool/state/projects/<project-id>/taskgov.sqlite
```

`<project-id>` must be deterministic from the canonical target project path. It
should use a sanitized target project directory basename plus a short stable
SHA-256 hash of the canonical path, for example:

```text
kurakoma-a1b2c3d4e5f6
```

The CLI must support `--db` to override the default path.

## Task Model

The MVP task record includes:

- `task_id`: stable ID such as `tg_task_...`.
- `project_id`: deterministic project ID.
- `title`: required short title.
- `description`: optional detail.
- `kind`: `sequential` or `optional`.
- `lane`: optional grouping string; normally required for ordered sequential
  work.
- `lane_order`: integer order within a lane.
- `priority`: `low`, `normal`, `high`, or `urgent`.
- `status`: `ready`, `in_progress`, `paused`, `blocked`, `review_pending`,
  `done`, or `cancelled` after TG-M8. The pre-TG-M8 schema does not contain
  `paused`.
- `blocked_reason`: required when status is `blocked`.
- `pause_reason`: required when status is `paused` after TG-M8.
- `review_tier`: integer `0`, `1`, or `2`.
- `verification`: short verification expectation or command label.
- `tags`: comma-separated labels.
- `created_at`, `updated_at`, and optional `completed_at` timestamps.

The MVP may store task notes and state changes in a concise task event history.

## Implemented Post-MVP Extension: Completion Commit Gate

This extension made task completion auditable without adding a heavy
material-tracking schema. Its generic revision and boolean-only review details
are historical baseline behavior and are superseded for new transitions by the
approved TG-M8 contract below.

A task may be marked `done` only after all of these gates are satisfied:

- Required verification for the task has passed or has an explicit documented
  user-approved exception.
- Required sub-agent review has completed under the same tiered review rules
  used by this project: Tier 2 requires two independent review passes when
  review tooling is available; Tier 1 requires one independent review or the
  documented fallback when tooling is unavailable; Tier 0 may skip review only
  for purely mechanical changes.
- If Tier 2 review tooling is unavailable, the strongest feasible documented
  self-review must be run and the user must explicitly approve treating that
  fallback as completion evidence before the task can be marked `done`.
- No valid high or medium review finding remains unresolved.
- The commit gate has passed according to the task's commit requirement fields.

Managed materials are source-controlled files or user-approved durable assets
whose final state should be traceable after task completion. Generated local
runtime state, caches, logs, temporary files, SQLite databases, and ignored
scratch artifacts are not managed materials unless a governing document or user
explicitly says they are.

The database must keep commit evidence intentionally simple. Store commit state
directly on the task row:

- `completion_commit_required`: boolean-like value, default true.
- `completion_commit_hash`: concise commit hash or unique revision identifier,
  empty by default.

Completion commit rules:

- If `completion_commit_required=true`, `completion_commit_hash` is required
  before the task can be marked `done`.
- If no managed materials changed, the user or agent must explicitly set
  `completion_commit_required=false`; then `completion_commit_hash` must stay
  empty. This is the explicit commit-not-required decision.
- `completion_commit_required=false` with a non-empty
  `completion_commit_hash` is invalid.
- A Git commit hash is preferred for Git projects. For non-Git managed
  materials, a user-approved unique revision ID may be stored in
  `completion_commit_hash`.
- The hash or revision ID must be unique enough to identify the final material
  state in the target project's durable history.

The database does not store changed material paths in this simplified design.
To trace changed materials for a completed historical task, read the task's
`completion_commit_hash` and inspect the target project's version-control
history, for example:

```powershell
git show --name-only <completion_commit_hash>
```

Valid review evidence by tier:

- Tier 2: `passed` with at least two independent reviewers, or
  `unavailable_fallback` only when review tooling is unavailable, the strongest
  feasible documented self-review was completed, and the user explicitly
  approved the fallback.
- Tier 1: `passed` with at least one independent reviewer, or
  `unavailable_fallback` with a documented self-review when review tooling is
  unavailable.
- Tier 0: `not_required` is valid only for purely mechanical changes with no
  behavior, schema, API, privacy, setup, persistence, or documentation contract
  risk.

This simplified extension does not add separate verification or review tables.
The `done` transition must still require explicit command-time confirmation
that required verification and review gates have passed or have an approved
fallback. The CLI may record those confirmations as concise task events, but it
must not store full transcripts or raw command output.

Completion transition interface:

- `task edit --status done` must require `--verification-complete`.
- `task edit --status done` must require `--review-complete`.
- `--verification-complete` means required verification passed or a documented
  user-approved exception exists.
- `--review-complete` means the required review gate passed, or a valid
  documented fallback/not-required decision exists for the task's review tier.
- `--completion-commit-hash <hash>` records the commit hash or unique revision
  ID used when `completion_commit_required=true`.
- `--commit-not-required` explicitly sets `completion_commit_required=false`
  for a task with no managed material changes.

The extension must not store raw diffs, raw command output, full review
transcripts, full prompts, secrets, stack traces, environment dumps, or large
logs by default.

When this extension is implemented, `task edit --status done` must reject
completion with structured errors if required verification, review, or commit
state is missing or inconsistent. The error codes should include
`verification_required`, `review_required`, `commit_required`, and
`completion_commit_conflict` unless a later approved CLI contract chooses
narrower names.

## Approved Post-MVP Extension: TG-M8 Governance Hardening

TG-M8 supersedes the simplified completion-evidence and boolean-only review
parts of the completion commit extension. It preserves the local-first SQLite
ledger, compact JSON envelope, project identity, privacy boundary, and
read-only target-project policy.

### Explicit Initialization

`taskgov db init` is the only command allowed to create or migrate a database.
All task write commands must open an already initialized database at the
current schema version. A missing database must produce
`db_not_initialized` without creating a file or parent state directory. An
older supported database must produce `migration_required` without applying a
migration. `--read-only` must continue to reject every write path before any
database or Git change.

### Initial Done Prohibition

`taskgov task add --status done` is prohibited. It must fail with
`initial_done_forbidden` before a task or event is stored. Historical import or
migration, if later required, must use a separately approved explicit command;
normal task registration must not double as an import bypass.

Initial `task add --status paused` is also prohibited with
`initial_paused_forbidden`; pausing is a transition for work already in
progress or review.

### Paused Work And Sequential Transition Enforcement

`paused` represents active work intentionally put on hold. It is distinct from
`blocked`, which means progress depends on a named blocking condition.

- Moving a task to `paused` requires a concise sanitized `pause_reason`.
- Only `in_progress` or `review_pending` work may move directly to `paused`.
- Normal resumption moves `paused` back to `in_progress`.
- `paused` tasks are excluded from `task next` and included in `task current`.
- A `paused` sequential predecessor remains incomplete and blocks later tasks
  in the same lane.
- A sequential task may enter `in_progress`, `review_pending`, or `done` only
  when every earlier task in its lane is `done` or `cancelled`.
- The rule applies to initial `task add` status as well as `task edit`.
  Initial `done` remains prohibited separately.
- An add or edit that changes kind, lane, order, or status must validate the
  complete resulting row and every affected old/new lane. It must reject an
  insertion or reorder that would place an incomplete predecessor before an
  already `in_progress`, `review_pending`, or `done` task.
- A failed transition must return `sequential_predecessor_incomplete` and must
  not change the task or append a success event.
- `task next` and task transitions must use the same predecessor-completeness
  implementation. TG-M8 does not add a general dependency graph or an
  administrative override.

### Current Task Rediscovery

TG-M8 adds the read-only command `taskgov task current`. It returns tasks in
`in_progress`, `review_pending`, `paused`, or `blocked`, including task fields,
the latest event when present, `updated_at`, and a deterministic suggested next
action. The default limit is `20`.

Default ordering is status (`in_progress`, `review_pending`, `paused`, then
`blocked`), priority (`urgent`, `high`, `normal`, `low`), newest `updated_at`,
and `task_id` for deterministic ties. `task next` remains ready-task selection;
it is not changed into a resume command.

Stale-age calculation, persistent checkpoints, and event-history pagination
are deferred. The command must not claim that `updated_at` proves repository
working-tree freshness.

### Completion Evidence Kinds And Git Validation

Every new TG-M8 completion transition must use one explicit evidence kind:

- `git_commit`: an existing commit in the target Git repository.
- `external_revision`: an existing durable revision outside the target Git
  history, with a concise sanitized reason and explicit acknowledgement.
- `commit_not_required`: an explicit statement that no managed material
  changed.

For `git_commit`, the CLI must verify the supplied revision as a commit using a
read-only Git command. A unique abbreviated hash may be accepted, but missing,
ambiguous, or non-commit revisions must fail with
`git_commit_not_found_or_ambiguous`. The canonical full object ID must be
stored. Validation must not change `HEAD`, the index, the worktree, refs, or
configuration.

`external_revision` must never be inferred from an arbitrary string. It
requires an explicit evidence kind, revision value, reason,
`--external-revision-approved`, and audit event. In a Git project the
acknowledgement specifically confirms that the external system, rather than the
available Git history, is the approved durable source of the completed
materials. Missing acknowledgement returns
`external_revision_approval_required`. `commit_not_required` stores no revision
value.

The existing `--completion-commit-hash` option remains a Git-only compatibility
alias for `git_commit`; it no longer accepts a generic revision string.
Existing schema-v2 rows and their original hashes must be retained. Migration
may label historical evidence `legacy_unverified`; it must not rewrite or
retroactively invalidate completed tasks.

### Structured Review Evidence

TG-M8 stores sanitized review receipts and findings rather than full review
text or private reasoning. Each task has a current review target identified by
`git_commit`, `diff_fingerprint`, or `external_revision` and its value. Git
targets are verified and canonicalized like completion Git evidence. Every
target-set operation also advances a monotonic target generation, including
when the kind/value returns to an earlier value.
Each receipt records a stable reviewer key, receipt kind, verdict, the exact
target, a concise summary, and timestamps. Each finding records severity,
resolution status, a concise summary, and resolution metadata.

Completion rules are:

- Tier 2 requires two `PASS` receipts from distinct independent reviewer keys
  for the same current review target.
- Tier 1 requires one independent `PASS` receipt for the current target.
- Tier 2 tooling-unavailable fallback requires a documented self-review
  `PASS` receipt and explicit user approval recorded as structured evidence.
- Tier 1 tooling-unavailable fallback requires a documented self-review
  `PASS` receipt.
- Tier 0 may use a `not_required` receipt only with a concise mechanical-change
  rationale.
- Any unresolved `high` or `medium` finding blocks completion.
- Changing or re-setting the current review target advances its generation and
  prevents every older-generation receipt from satisfying the gate, even for
  an A-to-B-to-A target sequence.
- Resolving a high or medium finding does not by itself restore completion
  eligibility. The current target generation must be greater than the
  generation of the receipt that produced the finding, and fresh required PASS
  receipts must target that newer generation. Minor record-only edits and low
  findings that do not change the target do not trigger review calls.

Reviewer keys provide mechanically checkable distinctness, not identity
proof. The agent remains responsible for using genuinely independent review
passes. `--review-complete` remains a command-time compatibility confirmation,
but cannot substitute for missing structured evidence.

The normal successful Tier 2 path therefore uses two LLM review decisions.
Recording or validating receipts, reviewer distinctness, target equality,
findings, and Git commits is deterministic and adds no LLM decision. One
finding/fix cycle normally adds two fresh final-review decisions, for four
review decisions in total; each additional meaningful fix cycle adds two.

### Deferred Feedback

TG-M8 does not add verification receipts, stale-active detection, persistent
handoff checkpoints, event-history pagination, or parent/child execution
units. Large tasks may continue to use concise task events and bounded roadmap
units. A checklist or child-task feature should be reconsidered only after
operational evidence from `paused` and `task current` shows that the simple lane
model is insufficient.

## Approved Post-MVP Extension: Static Task Viewer

The tool must provide a user-facing, non-server task viewer after the core task
and completion flows are stable. The application name is `Task Viewer` and the
CLI entry point is:

```powershell
taskgov web export --repo <target-project> [--output <html-path>]
```

This extension is a generated static snapshot, not a live dashboard. The CLI
reads the existing SQLite database in read-only mode, embeds a bounded task
snapshot into one self-contained HTML file, and exits. Opening the file must not
require Python, a local HTTP server, a browser extension, a network connection,
or direct browser access to SQLite.

### Export Behavior

`web export` must:

- require an initialized, current-schema database and preserve the existing
  `db_not_initialized`, `migration_required`, and `project_mismatch` behavior
- open SQLite read-only and write no database rows, task events, tool events, or
  migrations
- reject active WAL sidecars and persistent WAL journal mode before the viewer
  snapshot connection so export and `--read-only` create no SQLite sidecars
- export every task status, including `done` and `cancelled`, while allowing
  the browser UI to hide terminal tasks by default
- include all task fields exposed by `task show`, including
  `completion_commit_required` and `completion_commit_hash`
- include at most the 10 most recent task events per task, newest first
- preserve current `task list`, `task show`, and other CLI JSON contracts
- replace the selected HTML file atomically so a failed render does not leave a
  partial viewer
- make snapshot age visible through a UTC `generated_at` timestamp in the
  rendered application

The default output path is generated skill-local runtime state:

```text
<installed-skill-root>/state/projects/<project-id>/viewer/task-viewer.html
```

The default viewer directory may be created by `web export`. An explicit
`--output` path is a separate file-write destination and requires explicit user
approval when Codex invokes it. Its parent directory must already exist; the
command must not create arbitrary explicit-output parent directories. The path
must end in `.html` or `.htm`. For either default or explicit output, an
existing directory, symbolic link, or non-regular-file destination must be
rejected.

An explicit output that resolves inside the canonical target project must stay
under the installed skill's generated `state/` directory. Other explicit
destinations inside the target project must be rejected with
`output_path_invalid`, even when their parent exists. A user-approved explicit
destination outside the target project remains allowed.

An explicit `--db` changes only the SQLite source. It must not move the default
HTML output away from the installed skill's generated state directory.

Generating or regenerating either default or explicit output requires explicit
user intent in the current task. A request only to inspect or summarize task
state does not authorize an HTML write. Codex may use `--read-only` to preview
the resolved output and counts before that intent is granted.

`--read-only` acts as a dry preview for this command. It must read and validate
the database and template, report the resolved output path and snapshot counts,
set `written=false`, and create or replace no HTML or directories.

The command must not open a browser automatically. Browser opening remains a
separate user action.

### Snapshot Contract

The embedded snapshot is an internal, versioned data contract with this
top-level shape:

```json
{
  "snapshot_version": 3,
  "generated_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "project": {
    "project_id": "example-a1b2c3d4e5f6",
    "display_name": "example"
  },
  "source_schema_version": 5,
  "counts": {
    "total": 0,
    "ready": 0,
    "in_progress": 0,
    "paused": 0,
    "blocked": 0,
    "review_pending": 0,
    "done": 0,
    "cancelled": 0
  },
  "tasks": []
}
```

Each snapshot version uses an explicit task-field allow-list plus an `events`
array. Final TG-M8 snapshot version 3 contains the current `task show` task
fields and a bounded structured-evidence projection: current target/generation,
gate and blocking-finding counts, and at most 10 latest sanitized receipts or
findings per task. Intermediate version 2 adds pause fields but does not expose
schema-v4 evidence early. The snapshot must not add the canonical repository
path or database path. Stored task text remains subject to the existing
write-time privacy checks.

Snapshot version 1 is the implemented schema-v2/six-status baseline. TG-M8.2
introduces snapshot version 2 with `paused`, `pause_reason`, and a seven-status
count. TG-M8.6 introduces snapshot version 3 with the final typed-completion
and structured-review projection. The exporter and bundled template must
support the version produced by the installed schema; generated historical
HTML remains self-contained and needs no upgrade.

The snapshot JSON must be encoded before insertion into the HTML so stored task
text cannot terminate a script element or inject markup. Browser rendering
must place stored text through text-only DOM APIs rather than interpreting it as
HTML.

### CLI Output Contract

The stable command name is `web.export`. A successful JSON result uses the
normal envelope and includes:

```json
{
  "output_path": "C:/.../task-viewer.html",
  "written": true,
  "replaced": false,
  "task_count": 0,
  "event_count": 0,
  "generated_at": "2026-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  "snapshot_version": 3
}
```

`written` must be false for `--read-only`. Text output must state the resolved
path, task count, generation timestamp, and whether the file was written or
only previewed.

`event_count` is the number of bounded recent-event rows actually embedded
across all exported tasks.

After command and output-path resolution, error results must preserve this
command-specific `data` shape with `written=false`, `replaced=false`, zero
counts, `generated_at=null`, and the resolved `output_path` when available. If
output-path resolution itself fails, `output_path` is null. The error result
retains the schema-appropriate snapshot version after command resolution.

New user-correctable error codes are:

- `output_path_invalid`
- `output_parent_missing`

An operating-system write failure uses `output_write_failed` and exit code 2.
An absent or malformed bundled template is an `internal_error`.

### Viewer Experience

The viewer must be a read-only operational interface. It must provide:

- project identity and snapshot generation time
- status totals for all seven TG-M8 task statuses
- text search across task ID, title, description, lane, tags, and commit hash
- status, kind, lane, priority, and tag filters
- a default view that emphasizes active tasks while keeping terminal history
  available
- deterministic task ordering consistent with `task list`
- a task detail view for description, blocker, verification, review tier,
  completion commit state, timestamps, tags, and recent events
- responsive desktop and mobile layouts, keyboard access, visible focus,
  associated form labels, and readable contrast

The viewer must not provide task-edit, completion, commit, or database-write
controls. It must not imply live refresh; the displayed `generated_at` value is
the freshness boundary.

### Viewer Safety And Non-Goals

The generated HTML must use bundled inline HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. It
must not use a CDN, external font, analytics, telemetry, fetch/XHR, WebSocket,
service worker, cookie, or local-storage persistence. A restrictive content
security policy must disable network connections and unrelated resource loads
while permitting the bundled inline application code. The exact accepted
policy and the reason for its inline-script/style exception are defined in
`docs/design.md` and must be browser-tested through `file://`.

This extension does not include:

- direct SQLite access from browser JavaScript or a file picker
- live database watching or automatic regeneration
- task registration or editing in the browser
- a local or remote HTTP server
- sharing, synchronization, authentication, or multi-user coordination
- browser launch without an explicit user request

### Viewer Acceptance Criteria

The extension is acceptable when:

- `web export` and `web export --read-only` satisfy their JSON and write-safety
  contracts against temporary databases
- the generated file opens through `file://` and remains useful with networking
  unavailable
- all statuses, completion commit fields, and bounded recent events render
  correctly
- stored HTML-shaped text is rendered as text and cannot execute
- default and explicit output-path rules are covered by tests
- existing CLI contracts and the full offline test suite remain green
- desktop and mobile browser checks show no blank view, overlap, clipped
  controls, or unreadable task content
- the installable skill remains self-contained and release artifacts include
  the required viewer asset but exclude generated viewer snapshots

### Approved Follow-Up Requirement: Default-Browser Launch

After an explicit user request to display the Task Viewer, the tool must be
able to open a generated Task Viewer HTML file directly in the operating
system's configured default browser.

This capability must preserve the static-snapshot boundary: opening the file
must not add browser-to-SQLite access, a local server, live refresh, automatic
regeneration, or browser-side task mutation. A generic task-state inspection,
an export-only request, or `web export --read-only` must not launch a browser.

This requirement does not yet approve a command name, option, interaction
flow, regeneration policy, error contract, or implementation task. Those
decisions must be added to `docs/design.md` and
`docs/implementation-roadmap.md` before implementation. Until then, the
existing `web export` contract remains generation-only and does not launch a
browser.

## Task Ordering

Task selection must support both sequence-sensitive and free-order work.

- `optional` tasks are actionable when their status is `ready`.
- `sequential` tasks are actionable when their status is `ready` and all earlier
  tasks in the same `lane` are `done` or `cancelled`.
- After TG-M8, the same earlier-task predicate must guard direct transitions to
  `in_progress`, `review_pending`, and `done`; `paused` is incomplete.
- A blocked sequential lane must not hide ready optional tasks or ready tasks in
  other lanes.

The MVP uses `lane` plus `lane_order` instead of a general dependency graph.

## CLI Requirements

All MVP commands must support:

- `--repo`: target project root; default current directory.
- `--db`: explicit SQLite path override.
- `--json`: machine-readable output for Codex.
- `--read-only`: prohibit database creation, migration, or writes. Inspection
  commands behave as read-only even when this flag is omitted.

Inspection commands must not create or migrate databases by default. Commands
that write to the task-governance-tool database must state what they recorded in
both JSON and text output.

### `taskgov db init`

Purpose: explicitly create or migrate the current project database.

Required output:

- database path
- project ID
- whether the database was created
- migration versions applied
- final schema version

### `taskgov db status`

Purpose: show whether the current task database is usable.

This command is read-only by default. If the database does not exist or needs a
schema migration, it must report that state without creating or migrating the
database. Use `taskgov db init` to create or migrate the database.

Required output:

- database path
- schema version
- whether the database exists
- whether initialization is needed
- whether migration is needed
- project ID
- active task count
- blocked task count
- review-pending task count
- done task count
- next-actionable task count

### `taskgov task add`

Purpose: register one explicit task as current state.

Required arguments:

- `--title`

Optional arguments:

- `--description`
- `--kind`, default `optional`
- `--lane`
- `--order`
- `--priority`, default `normal`
- `--status`, default `ready`
- `--blocked-reason`, required when initial `--status` is `blocked`
- `--review-tier`, default `1` unless project rules later say otherwise
- `--verification`
- `--tags`

Adding a task is an explicit registration action. The MVP does not create draft
tasks. If a sequential task omits `--lane` or `--order`, the CLI may store a
deterministic default lane and append order; command output must include the
stored `lane` and `lane_order` so the auto-filled ordering is visible.

If `task add` sets initial `--status blocked`, it must require
`--blocked-reason`. The CLI must reject blocked task creation without a blocked
reason before any row is stored.

After TG-M8, this command must not create or migrate a database and must reject
initial `--status done` with `initial_done_forbidden`. Initial
`in_progress` or `review_pending` must pass the shared sequential predecessor
rule when the new task is sequential. Initial `paused` fails with
`initial_paused_forbidden`.

### `taskgov task list`

Purpose: return compact filtered task lists.

Supported filters:

- `--status`
- `--kind`
- `--lane`
- `--priority`
- `--tag`
- `--limit`, default around 20
- `--include-done`

### `taskgov task next`

Purpose: return ready work candidates without loading all task history.

Selection rules:

- Include only `status=ready`.
- Include ready `optional` tasks directly.
- Include ready `sequential` tasks only when earlier tasks in the lane are
  complete or cancelled.
- Exclude `in_progress`, `blocked`, `review_pending`, `done`, and `cancelled`.
- Supported filters are `--kind`, `--lane`, `--priority`, and `--limit`.
- Default limit is `5`.
- Priority order is `urgent`, `high`, `normal`, `low`.
- Sort by priority rank, lane, lane order with nulls last, creation time, and
  `task_id` for deterministic ties.

### `taskgov task current`

Purpose: rediscover work already started, under review, paused, or blocked.

This TG-M8 inspection command is read-only and includes only `in_progress`,
`review_pending`, `paused`, and `blocked`. It returns the latest event and a
deterministic suggested next action for each task. Its default limit is `20`.
It does not perform stale-age or working-tree freshness analysis.

### `taskgov task show`

Purpose: show one task and immediate context.

Required output:

- task fields
- recent notes or events
- timestamps
- suggested next action

After schema version 5, `task show` also returns `review_evidence` with the
current target/generation, tier requirement, current-generation qualifying
receipt counts, fallback state, blocking-finding counts and up to 10 sanitized
recent receipts/findings. This is a read-only projection, not raw review text.

### `taskgov task edit`

Purpose: update task state or metadata.

Editable fields:

- `--title`
- `--description`
- `--kind`
- `--lane`
- `--order`
- `--priority`
- `--status`
- `--blocked-reason`
- `--pause-reason` after TG-M8
- `--review-tier`
- `--verification`
- `--tags`
- `--add-note`
- `--completion-evidence-kind`, `--completion-revision`, and
  `--completion-evidence-reason` after TG-M8
- `--external-revision-approved` after TG-M8
- existing `--completion-commit-hash` and `--commit-not-required`

When setting `--status blocked`, `--blocked-reason` is required.
After TG-M8, setting `--status paused` requires `--pause-reason`, sequential
start/review/completion transitions enforce the shared predecessor rule, and
completion enforces structured review and explicit completion evidence. The
guard evaluates the resulting kind, lane, order, and status together and checks
both affected lanes when ordering metadata changes.

`task block` and `task done` aliases are postponed. Use `task edit` in the MVP.

### TG-M8 Review Evidence Commands

`taskgov review target set <task-id>` sets the task's current review target.
It requires `--kind` with `git_commit`, `diff_fingerprint`, or
`external_revision`, plus `--revision`. A Git target is verified and stored as
its canonical full commit ID; a diff fingerprint must be canonical
`sha256:<64-lowercase-hex>`. Changing a target appends an audit event and does
not delete older receipts. Every set, including re-setting the same value,
advances the target generation so historical receipts cannot reactivate.

`taskgov review receipt add <task-id>` stores one sanitized receipt for the
current target. It requires `--reviewer`, `--kind`, and `--verdict`; optional
`--summary` and the Tier 2 fallback `--user-approved` flag follow the structured
review rules above. Callers do not provide a separate target on this command.
The task and current target must exist, and the receipt kind, verdict, approval,
tier, and rationale combination must be valid as a unit.

`taskgov review finding add <task-id>` stores a sanitized finding and requires
`--receipt-id`, `--severity`, and `--summary`. The receipt must belong to the
same task and current project. Task and project identity are derived from the
loaded receipt rather than trusted from caller-provided values.

`taskgov review finding resolve <finding-id>` requires `--resolution` and
preserves the original finding. These commands never launch reviewers or make
LLM calls; they record and validate evidence produced by the approved workflow.

## JSON Output

JSON output must be stable enough for Codex to consume. Each command should emit
a top-level object with:

- `ok`: boolean.
- `command`: command name.
- `project_id`: when applicable.
- `db_path`: when applicable.
- `data`: command-specific payload.
- `errors`: list of structured errors.
- `warnings`: list of structured warnings.

Human-readable output should be concise and should not replace JSON contracts.

Command names must be stable:

- `db.init`
- `db.status`
- `task.add`
- `task.list`
- `task.next`
- `task.current`
- `task.show`
- `task.edit`
- `review.target.set`
- `review.receipt.add`
- `review.finding.add`
- `review.finding.resolve`

Exit codes:

- `0`: success.
- `1`: validation or user-correctable command error.
- `2`: database, migration, or unexpected tool error.

Timestamps in JSON must use UTC ISO-8601 strings. Paths should be emitted as
normalized absolute strings for local display; IDs must not encode private path
details.

Required `data` payloads:

- `db.init`: `created`, `migrations_applied`, `schema_version`.
- `db.status`: `exists`, `needs_init`, `needs_migration`, `schema_version`,
  `counts`.
- `task.add`: `task`, `event`.
- `task.list`: `tasks`, `count`, `limit`.
- `task.next`: `tasks`, `count`, `limit`, `selection_rules`.
- `task.current`: `tasks`, `count`, `limit`, `statuses`.
- `task.show`: `task`, `events`, `suggested_next_action`, and
  `review_evidence` after schema version 5.
- `task.edit`: `task`, `changed_fields`, `event`.
- `review.target.set`: `task`, `changed_fields`, `event`.
- `review.receipt.add`: `receipt`, `event`.
- `review.finding.add`: `finding`, `event`.
- `review.finding.resolve`: `finding`, `event`.

Task objects in JSON must use the same field names as the task model. The
`review_tier` value must be an integer, not a string.

In `db.status`, `counts.active` means tasks with status `ready`,
`in_progress`, `paused`, `blocked`, or `review_pending` after TG-M8. It
excludes `done` and `cancelled`.

Required error codes:

- `invalid_argument`
- `invalid_status`
- `invalid_kind`
- `invalid_priority`
- `invalid_review_tier`
- `blocked_reason_required`
- `pause_reason_required`
- `initial_done_forbidden`
- `initial_paused_forbidden`
- `invalid_status_transition`
- `sequential_predecessor_incomplete`
- `privacy_rejected`
- `not_found`
- `db_not_initialized`
- `migration_required`
- `project_mismatch`
- `review_target_required`
- `review_receipts_insufficient`
- `review_finding_unresolved`
- `review_receipt_mismatch`
- `review_receipt_already_recorded`
- `invalid_review_evidence`
- `verification_required`
- `review_required`
- `commit_required`
- `completion_commit_conflict`
- `completion_evidence_conflict`
- `git_commit_not_found_or_ambiguous`
- `external_revision_approval_required`
- `internal_error`

## Privacy And Safety

The MVP must:

- Write only to the task-governance-tool SQLite database by default.
- Never modify target project source files, Git state, issues, PRs, or external
  services.
- Treat project-scoped installation and generated state creation as explicit
  user-approved setup/write actions. Generated state under
  `.agents/skills/task-governance-tool/state/` must be ignored or kept out of
  commits.
- Never store API keys, tokens, cookies, authorization headers, raw provider
  bodies, full private prompts, full chat logs, large raw diffs, raw stdout, raw
  stderr, stack traces, or environment dumps.
- Treat `state/` as generated local runtime state.
- Keep root copied reference material non-authoritative.

Free-form fields are allowed only as concise sanitized task metadata. The CLI
must reject obvious secret, log, or diff content before storing user text.
Warnings may be used only for non-stored borderline content or non-blocking
normalization notes.

MVP size limits:

- `title`: 200 characters.
- `description`: 4000 characters.
- `verification`: 500 characters.
- `tags`: 500 characters.
- `--add-note`: 2000 characters.
- event `summary`: 1000 characters.
- review target value, external revision value, and reviewer key: 500
  characters each.
- pause reason, review receipt summary, review finding summary, and finding
  resolution summary: 1000 characters each.

The CLI must reject obvious secrets and raw dump patterns, including bearer
tokens, authorization headers, private key blocks, `password=`, `token=`,
`api_key=`, raw stack traces, raw stdout/stderr dumps, and large raw diffs.

## Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is acceptable when:

- The skill package metadata validates or passes the documented self-check.
- `taskgov db status` inspects a project database without creating or migrating
  it.
- `taskgov db init` creates or migrates a project database safely.
- `taskgov task add/list/show/edit/next` work against a temporary database.
- `task next` correctly works around blocked sequential lanes.
- JSON outputs are tested for shape and key fields.
- Free-form privacy rejection and size-limit behavior are tested.
- No command mutates target project source files or Git state.
- Generated SQLite databases and root copied references are ignored by Git.

TG-M8 is acceptable only when automated tests additionally prove:

- initial `task add --status done` fails without storing a task or event;
- initial `task add --status paused` fails, and invalid pause/resume source
  transitions return a stable error without mutation;
- a later sequential task cannot be started, reviewed, or completed while an
  earlier same-lane task is incomplete, including when it is paused;
- task registration and combined kind/lane/order/status edits cannot insert or
  reorder an incomplete predecessor ahead of active, review-pending, or done
  same-lane work;
- `task current` rediscovers active, review-pending, paused, and blocked work
  without writing the database or Git state;
- Tier 2 completion requires two distinct `PASS` receipts for the same current
  target and fails with any unresolved high or medium finding;
- resolving a high or medium finding without advancing the target generation
  remains blocked; a newer target plus fresh required PASS receipts succeeds;
- one reviewer cannot replace or contradict a receipt in the same target
  generation; re-review requires a new target generation;
- `task show` exposes the current review gate and bounded sanitized evidence so
  a new session can diagnose completion readiness without a write or LLM call;
- nonexistent or ambiguous Git commit evidence is rejected and a valid short
  hash is stored canonically;
- missing or old-schema databases are not created or migrated by task writes;
- schema migrations retain a realistic fixture with 12 tasks, 191 events, and
  all historical completion hashes;
- privacy rejection covers all new free-form fields;
- concurrent updates retain SQLite integrity; and
- the existing project-identity, `task next`, compact JSON-envelope, viewer,
  and `--read-only` contracts do not regress.
